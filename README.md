# Python-Projects
# My Python Project Portfolio

### Welcome!

This repository is where I'm documenting my Python journey by building projects. I believe the best way to learn is by doing, so here you'll find a collection of games that I've developed from the ground up.

Each project helped me tackle new challenges and learn something new, progressing from simple text-based applications to more complex graphical games.

## Projects

Below is a summary of the projects in this portfolio. Each project has its own folder with a more detailed `README.md` file inside.

### 1. [Snake, Water, Gun (Text-Based AI Game)](./Snake-Water-Gun-AI/)

A command-line version of the classic game with a twist: an AI that learns from the player's moves. This project focuses on Python fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and file I/O.

### 2. [Snake and Ladder (Graphical Game)](./Snake-and-Ladder-GUI/)

A fully functional, graphical version of the classic board game Snake and Ladder. This project demonstrates GUI development, animation, and the integration of external libraries for multimedia.

I plan on adding more complex projects as I continue to grow as a developer. Thanks for visiting!
